# Product Workspace for PM’s, BAs, and product enthusiasts

To streamline my product work and avoid reinventing the wheel, I built a complete Product Lifecycle Workspace with reusable templates covering ideation, discovery, design, planning, handoff, and launch.

This Notion workspace will demonstrate:

→ You understand the full product lifecycle

→ You follow industry-standard templates

→ You are process-driven and organized

→ You can bring immediate structure to a team

Below are the product lifecycle stages with reusable templates at each stage.
